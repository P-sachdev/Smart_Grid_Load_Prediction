# Smart Load Forecasting using Hybrid Deep Learning with Fuzzy Smoothing

This project implements a **deep learning-based time series forecasting model** to predict future energy load in a smart grid system. The architecture combines **Conv1D**, **Bidirectional LSTM**, and **Multi-Head Attention**, enhanced with **fuzzy logic smoothing** for better error control. It includes advanced feature engineering techniques such as lag features, rolling statistics, time encoding, and fuzzy membership functions.
